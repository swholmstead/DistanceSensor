<h2>Bill of Materials</h2>

All of these components are common and can be found online.  I have provided links to Amazon and AliExpress, but these vendors may change over time.
If the links don't work, just search for the components from wherever you shop.

* ESP8266 D1 Mini controller (qty 1) [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BK986HLZ) [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.us/item/3256807691590176.html)
    * There are older versions with micro USB connector.  I prefer the newer version with USB-C connector.  Either will work.

    * This project only needs 40 LEDs.  You can cut the strip to length as long as you cut in the middle of the
      copper solder pads.  
    * You can also change the number of LEDs in software.  NOTE: More LEDs will draw more power, so you may need
      to check power consumption and ensure the power supply can supply it.
    * Make sure you buy the 5V version, NOT 12V or 24V.
    * You can buy different options with various levels of waterproofing
        * IP30 - no waterproofing
        * IP65 - covered in clear silicone (I used this one)
        * IP67 - incased in a waterproof sleeve
