This is a DIY parking sensor to assist you parking your vehicle in the garage.  It is simple to make and
is very affordable.  This project contains everything that you need to build the electronics, 3D print
the case, and download the software.

It uses an ultrasonic distance sensor to detect the distance to the car.  It displays the distance on the OLED
display and uses an LED strip to visual indicate your progress to the "perfect" parking distance.

There is a pushbutton to set the "perfect" parking distance.  Just position your vehicle where you want it to be
and push the SAVE button.  It stores that distance in EEPROM so that it will remember even after power fail.
